            <p tabindex="0"><i>The first traces of settlement in the Stavanger region date to the Ice Age and the time of the Vikings. Just two miles from central Stavanger, the Jernaldergarden Iron Age farmstead recreates today how Vikings lived in the area around 350-550 BC —with longhouses and burial mounds—based on excavations conducted by the Museum of Archaeology. </i></p>

                  Today, in the Hafrsfjord neighborhood, the imposing Swords in the Rock (Sverd i Fjell) monument commemorates the historic battle. Three giant bronze swords standing 33 ft. fall are stabbed into the rock of a small hill. Created by Norwegian sculptor Fritz Røed, the largest sword represents the victorious King Harald, and the two smaller swords represent the defeated petty kings.

                  One of Norway's oldest cities, Stavanger was officially founded in 1125, the same year that the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger Cathedral is Norway's only active cathedral that dates to the Middle Ages.  Originally built between 1122 and 1125 in the Anglo-Norman style, it was reconstructed with a Gothic chancel after suffering fire damage in 1272.

                  Home to nearly 200 18th and 19th century white timber houses, Stavanger's Old Town (Gamle Stavanger) is preserved as a historical monument. Closed to cars, the charming, pedestrian-friendly area includes restaurants, an open-air market, and small fishing boats along the harbor selling freshly caught shrimp, crab and lobsters.
