            <p tabindex="0"><i>Oslo is the capital and most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both as a county and a municipality. The municipality of Oslo Had a population of over seven-hounded thousand people as of 2022. Oslo is the economic and governmental center of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry, and shipping. The king of Norway (yes, we have a king), resides in Oslo as well and is not someone who decides the laws in Norway, that is the government's job.</i></p>
            <p tabindex="0"><i>
                  The Frogner Park is the world's largest sculpture park located in Oslo. There are over 212 sculptures made by only a single artist. We will take you to discover the magic in sculpture on our Best of Oslo Private Tour with Vigeland Sculpture Park & Viking Ship Museum.

                  The city wasn't always called Oslo. The city was first founded by King Harald Hardrada in 1050 and was then destroyed in a fire in 1624. After which, Christian IV of Denmark-Norway decided to build a new town a little more to the west and renamed it Christiania. In 1877, they changed the spelling to Kristiania, and then in 1925, the parliament changed the name to Oslo.

            <p tabindex="0"><i>Since 1947, Oslo has sent the Christmas tree that sits in London's Trafalgar square every year as a present for the UK's support in World War II.
                  The tree is selected way ahead of time from the forests around Olso and when it's cut down, the felling ceremony is attended by the Mayor of Oslo, Mayor of Westminster, and the British ambassador to Norway.
