            <p tabindex="0">My name is Richard Langtinn, I come from Trondheim, Norway, and I'm 27 years old. I have eight and a half years of experience of working as a certified pharmacy technician. I started this journey of web development in August 2020, while the covid was still at large, in November 2021, I lost nearly all motivation to be on this course, and I'm very happy that I got another chance of taking this course and others again. So far, it's also been a wonderful time, got a lot of new friends, great apartment and I look forward to what the future can bring. With the accessibility course, I've learned how to design a website that not only looks good, but is also accessible to people with disabilities and different needs.</p>
